Data

!!!!
Blade
blade is a template engine that laravel uses. blade.php extension.

!!!!
Routes

web.php (we work here, it loads all of our views or controllers)

Route::get('/', function () { // you can pass a req or res obj inside the function also
    return view('welcome'); // resource/views/welcome.etc
});

api.php (if we are creating a backend api)

!!!!
::

In PHP, the double colon :: is defined as Scope Resolution Operator. It used when when we want to access constants, properties and methods defined at class level. When referring to these items outside class definition, name of class is used along with scope resolution operator.

!!!!
=>

The double arrow operator, =>, is used as an access mechanism for arrays. This means that what is on the left side of it will have a corresponding value of what is on the right side of it in array context.

!!!!
->

The object operator, ->, is used in object scope to access methods and properties of an object. Itâ€™s meaning is to say that what is on the right of the operator is a member of the object instantiated into the variable on the left side of the operator.

!!!!
-> is used to call a method, or access a property, on the object of a class. I think is like the . of js.

=> is used to assign values to the keys of an array

Helper methods for debuging

!!!!
eloquent ORM (Object relational mapping)(mapeo relacional de objetos)

Data comes through a model in laravel.

eloquent gives us a very eloquent way to deal with our database, we can do the model name like listing, then find or findall, etc. Like sequelize.
There is many types of filtering and sortering available to us.

to create an eloquent model we can do it with the terminal like this:

php artisan make:model (ModelName)

That would put a Model file called ModelName (We use Uppercase on the first letter for models and in singular) with just a basic Class that will have access to eloquent stuff
Lets do it manually first.



!!!!
Database config

config -> database.php


we dont need to creat tables, laravel have files called migrations that do that for us

php artisan migrate creates the table as it its in the users migration file, we can modified the file to add more columns or change some constraits or sql stuff like NOT NULL, etc.
